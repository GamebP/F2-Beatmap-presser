# Random F2 Beatmap Selector

This C++ application generates randomness based on user input and simulates pressing the F2 key a certain number of times.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. Enter a number 'n' between 3 and 30 when prompted.
3. The application will calculate the number of times to press the F2 key based on the input.
4. Sit back and watch as the F2 key is pressed automatically.

## Dependencies

- This application uses the `chrono` and `thread` libraries for time-related functionality.
- It also uses the `_kbhit()` and `_getch()` functions from the `conio.h` library for keyboard input.
